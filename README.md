# ðŸ§± Anki general overview
This is a **basic anki deck template**, specifically made for language learning.
I've been using anki for many years to study Japanese and other languages, it's a great open-source free software which makes use of a modified SRS algorithm (Spaced Repetition System) to help you remember vocabulary, concepts and pretty much anything you want.

An anki deck is a "collection of cards", that is a collection of whatever vocabulary or concept you'd like to remember, each new word or concept you have in your deck is a "card". You can either make a deck yourself from scratch, download templates or download pre-made decks.

Anki is often used with language learning, but it can also be an extremely useful tool to help you with pretty much anything you'd like to learn and remember, for example I've used it multiple times to prepare for exams or tests. **Currently I'm using it to also study for the CCNA IT certification.**

Just don't overdo it or you'll find yourself with too many reviews per day and you won't be able to keep up, ideally you shouldn't be doing anki for more than 30-45 minutes a day.
You can find most shared decks here > https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks , and you can also download a plethora of add-ons to customize your anki here > https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons 
(I recommend "more overview stats", "review heatmap" and "true retention").   

**You can find the download link for this specific deck template at the bottom of this page.** Or you can modify a new deck yourself with the html/css files in here.

## ðŸ“• Deck features

- This deck is optimized for **single words** (studying vocabulary), which is what I'd recommend over making sentence cards.

- Works perfectly with the Yomichan extension, which you should use if you're studying Japanese and mining words (=creating cards).

- There is a field for the example sentence, it will contain the sentence you mine the word from.

- There is a script which creates switchable definitions. You can switch using the arrow keys or mouse-click.

- Works for both the anki mobile app and the desktop client.<br>


## How to use the html/css files

Open your new deck in Anki then go to ```Browse > Cards...```. If you can't find the ```Cards...``` button, it should be in the middle of the window you just opened, between ```Fields...``` and ```Preview```.
Then go to the folder here "AnkiFields-html" and copy the text from ```front.html``` to ```Front```, from ```back.html``` to ```Back``` and from ```styling.css``` to ```Styling```.

## Card samples
Here's a few samples from my deck, which I'm using to study Japanese. It's completely up to you how you want to customize the cards, you can have only text, or text + audio, or add video/images from whatever material you're using to learn from. In these samples, the font size has been increased by roughly 20% compared to the size you'll find by default in the deck.
