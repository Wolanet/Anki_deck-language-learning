# Anki decks overview
This is a basic anki deck template, specifically made for language learning. I've been using anki for many years to study Japanese and other languages, it's a great free software which makes use of a modified SRS algorithm (Space Repetition System) to help you remember vocabulary, concepts and pretty much anything else you want.
<br>
An anki deck is a "collection of cards", that is a collection of the vocabulary or the concepts you'd like to remember, you can either make one yourself from scratch, download templates or download pre-made decks.
Anki is often used to boost your language learning experience, but it can also be extremely useful to remember a lot of information when preparing for difficult exams, or simply for studying things you'd like to remember well.

You can find most decks here > https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks , and you can also download a plethora of add-ons to customize your anki here > https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons 
(I recommend "more overview stats", "review heatmap" and "true retention")


## Deck features

- Works perfectly with the Yomichan extension, which is pretty much mandatory for studying Japanese and mining (=creating cards) words.

- There is a field for the example sentence, that is, it's gonna automatically add the sentence you mine the word from.

- Formats the HTML created by Yomichan (or any other extension you might use) to create switchable definitions using the arrow keys or mouse-click.

- Works well both in the mobile and desktop version of anki. Hides the images in the mobile automatically but you can disable this function.


## Cards samples
here's a few samples from my deck, which I'm using to study Japanese. You can add images and/or videos, or you can simply have text with or without audio. It's completely up to you how you want to customize the cards.
