# Anki general overview
This is a **basic anki deck template**, specifically made for language learning. 
I've been using anki for many years to study Japanese and other languages, it's a great free software which makes use of a modified SRS algorithm (Space Repetition System) to help you remember vocabulary, concepts and pretty much anything you want.

An anki deck is a "collection of cards", that is a collection of the vocabulary or the concepts you'd like to remember. You can either make a deck yourself from scratch, download templates or download pre-made decks.

Anki is often used with language learning, but it can also be an extremely useful tool to help you study (exam or test prep); honestly you can use it and have great results with pretty much anything you'd like to learn and remember. Just don't overdo it or you'll find yourself with too many reviews/day and you won't be able to keep up, ideally you shouldn't be doing anki for more than 30-45 minutes a day.

You can find most decks here > https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks , and you can also download a plethora of add-ons to customize your anki here > https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons 
(I recommend "more overview stats", "review heatmap" and "true retention").   

**You can find the download link for this specific deck template at the bottom of this page.** Or you can modify a new deck yourself with the html/css files in here.

## Deck features

- This deck is optimized for **single words** (studying vocabulary), which is what I'd recommend over making sentence cards.

- Works perfectly with the Yomichan extension, which you should use if you're studying Japanese and mining words (=creating cards).

- There is a field for the example sentence, it will contain the sentence you mine the word from.

- It creates switchable definitions. You can switch using the arrow keys or mouse-click.

- Works for both the mobile and desktop version of anki. <br>

  

## How to use the html/css files

Open you new deck in Anki then go to ```Browse > Cards...```. If you can't find the ```Cards...``` button, it should be in the middle of the window you just opened, between ```Fields...``` and ```Preview```.
Then go to the folder here "AnkiFields-html" and copy the text from ```front.html``` to ```Front```, from ```back.html``` to ```Back``` and from ```styling.css``` to ```Styling```.

## Card samples
here's a few samples from my deck, which I'm using to study Japanese. It's completely up to you how you want to customize the cards, you can have only text, or text + audio, or add video/images from whatever anime or tv show or any other material you're using to learn from.

**Card with text, extra source audio and image** (download your preferred software to capture audio and video/images, then simply drag the file in the respective anki field)
