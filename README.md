# Anki general overview
This is a basic anki deck template, specifically made for language learning. 
I've been using anki for many years to study Japanese and other languages, it's a great free software which makes use of a modified SRS algorithm (Space Repetition System) to help you remember vocabulary, concepts and pretty much anything you want.

An anki deck is a "collection of cards", that is a collection of the vocabulary or the concepts you'd like to remember. You can either make a deck yourself from scratch, download templates or download pre-made decks.

Anki is often used with language learning, but it can also be an extremely useful tool to help you study (exam or test prep); honestly you can use it and have great results with pretty much anything you'd like to learn and remember. Just don't overdo it or you'll find yourself with too many reviews/day and you won't be able to keep up, ideally you shouldn't be doing anki for more than 30-45 minutes a day.

You can find most decks here > https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks , and you can also download a plethora of add-ons to customize your anki here > https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons 
(I recommend "more overview stats", "review heatmap" and "true retention").

## Deck features

- Works perfectly with the Yomichan extension, which is pretty much mandatory for studying Japanese and mining (=creating cards) words.

- There is a field for the example sentence, that is, it's gonna automatically add the sentence you mine the word from.

- Formats the HTML created by Yomichan (or any other extension you might use) to create switchable definitions using the arrow keys or mouse-click.

- Works well in both the mobile and desktop version of anki. <br><br>

## Card samples
here's a few samples from my deck, which I'm using to study Japanese. It's completely up to you how you want to customize the cards, you can have only text, or text + audio, or add video/images from whatever anime or tv show or any other material you're using to learn from.
